## Abstract

This monograph proposes a radical paradigm shift in fundamental physics: **singularity is not a problem to be solved, but the foundational ontological condition for reality itself.** It introduces a complete geometric-axiomatic model where spacetime, energy, matter, and gravity emerge from the fractal nodal tension of minimal forms (triangles/tetrahedrons) holding singularities. The work offers novel solutions to dark matter and quantum gravity by reinterpreting them as manifestations of this underlying architecture.

## Core Axioms

1.  **Law of the Singularity Point:** `S = {0 ↔ ∞}`
2.  **Law of the Minimally Stable Form:** `F_min ⇔ Presence(Singularity)`
3.  **Law of Minimally Allowable Deviations:** `Stability(U) ⇔ Maintenance(Δ_min(±))`
4.  **The π Law of Dynamic Equilibrium:** `U ∝ Stability(π)`
5.  **Law of the Quantum:** `Q = Singularity Point + Minimal Stable Form`
6.  **Law of the Gravitational Field:** `G ∝ Resonance(Sum(Q_i))`

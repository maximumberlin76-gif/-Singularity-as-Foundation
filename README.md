## Abstract

This monograph proposes a radical shift in perspective: **singularity is not a problem to be solved, but the foundational ontological condition for reality**. It introduces a geometric-axiomatic model where spacetime, energy, and gravity emerge from the fractal nodal tension of minimal forms (triangles/tetrahedrons) holding singularities. The work offers novel solutions to dark matter and quantum gravity by reinterpreting them as manifestations of this underlying architecture.

## Core Axioms

1.  **Axiom of Singularity:** All structure emerges from a Point - a primary condition without dimensions.
2.  **Axiom of Minimal Form:** Stable structure requires minimal form (triangle in 2D, tetrahedron in 3D).
3.  **Axiom of Tension:** Holding singularity within form creates tension (arcs) that becomes energy.
4.  **Axiom of Oscillation:** Tension inevitably becomes oscillation - the source of time.

## Key Insights

-   **Quantum as Fractal Node:** The quantum (Q) is a triune entity: localization (particle), connectivity (space), rhythm (time).
-   **Time Emergence:** Time is the phase desynchronization of quantum oscillations across the fractal network.
-   **Gravity from Retention:** Gravitational effects arise from the integrated tension of non-resonating nodes, offering a dark matter solution.
-   **Spherical Projection:** Tetrahedral quantum structure projects as a spherical energy cloud in 3D/4D.
